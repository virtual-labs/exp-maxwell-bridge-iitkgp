1)  Apply Supply voltage from the signal generator with arbitrary frequency. ( V =3v). Also set the unknown Inductance value from 'Set Inductor Value' tab.
 </br>
2)  Then switch on the supply to get millivoltmeter deflection.
 </br>
3)  Choose the values of   L<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> from the inductance and resistance box. Varry the values to some particular values to achieve "NULL".
 </br>
4) Observe the millivoltmeter pointer to achieve "NULL".
 </br>
5) If "NULL" is achieved, switch to 'Measure Inductor Value' tab and click on 'Simulate'. Observe the calculated values of unknown inductance (L<sub>1</sub>) and it's internal resistance (R<sub>1</sub>) of the inductor.
 </br>
6) Also observe the Dissipation factor of the unknwown inductor which is defined as `(omegaL)/R`.   Where, `omega=2pif`.
