      "question": "A Maxwell’s inductive bridge shown in figure below is used to measure an unknown inductance in comparison with known inductance. The values at balance R<sub>2</sub>= 500Ω, R<sub>4</sub>=600Ω, R<sub>3</sub>= 1000Ω, r<sub>2</sub>=100Ω and L<sub>2</sub>= 2mH. Calculate the values of R<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> . Calculate also the Q-factor of the coil if frequency is 1000Hz.<br/><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"image/quiz1.jpg\" style=\"width:460px;height:320px\"></p>",
